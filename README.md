# Computational_Thinking
 Computational Thinking Project - A program to compare the peformance of sorting algorithms.

---

**Description:**
 
 First Java program (excluding Hello World) written for Higher Diploma in Software Development course at ATU. 
 
 Compares the time complexity of Bubble Sort, Cocktail Shaker Sort, Counting Sort, Merge Sort and Quicksort algorithms.

---

**Instructions:**

* Verify Java installation (Command Prompt -> "java -version").
* Navigate to src folder.
* Compile to bytecode (javac ie\atu\dip\CTAControl\runner.java).
* Run the program (java ie.atu.dip.CTAControl.runner).
* Program will run sorting algorithms on random data sets of size n and display results in a table (shown below).
* Additional runs are included for Merge and Counting sort (to improve visibility when graphed).
